                  We work with partners to finance a 3-month internship in
                  Olerai Conservancy twice per year. Interns are engaged in
                  conservation, wildlife studies and research, tourism and tour
                  guiding and community service.

                  We have an active internship program for young people across
                  different backgrounds and interests. As active citizens of the
                  world, young people have the power to catalyze positive social
                  change in conservation and community development.
